# Hey, I'm Tarcísio 👋

**Full-stack developer from Brazil** turning coffee into code for 10+ years.

I build web apps, mobile apps, APIs, and occasionally break things in production (just kidding... mostly).

## What I do

- 🏗️ **Co-founder** at [SoftMakers](https://softmakers.com.br) — building digital products
- 💳 **Developer** at [FindUP](https://findup.com.br) — fintech stuff
- 🧠 Previously **CTO** — learned that meetings multiply faster than bugs

## Tech I work with

```
Frontend    → React, Next.js, TypeScript, React Native
Backend     → Node.js, NestJS, Python, Go
Data        → PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
Cloud       → AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes
```

## Current interests

- 📱 Building products that don't suck
- ☁️ Making infrastructure boring (in a good way)
